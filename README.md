# INF1018 - Program analysis
### Homework 2

For your mental sanity, I precompiled the program to devoir2.jar

#### USAGE:

```java -jar devoir2.jar <file path>```

Ex: ```java -jar devoir2.jar resources/program1.txt```

#### BUILDING:

This project uses Gradle. The task fatJar is configured to generate the executable program.

Ex: ```gradle fatJar```

The jar file can then be found within build/libs
